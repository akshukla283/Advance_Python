    "### Builder Design Pattern with Python\n",
    "\n",
    "The builder pattern is a type of creational design pattern, designed to provide a flexible solution to various object creation problems in object-oriented programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Builder design pattern intends to separate the construction of a complex object from its actual representation so that we can use the same construction process to create different representations for the same object.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Builder design pattern solves problems like:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* How can a class create different representations of a complex object?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* How can a class that includes creating a complex object be simplified?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "`Simply said, Builder design patterns represent a method to builds a complex object using simple objects and a step-by-step approach.`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us understand, by an example, where the builder pattern will help us. Let’s say there is a manufacturer producing cars (The complex product). A car can have many features and components such as autonomous driving, sunroof, supported fuel type(electric, petrol, Diesel) etc…\n",
