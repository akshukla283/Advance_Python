    "### Design Pattern In Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Design patterns are elegant solutions to repeating problems in software design. These are optimized, reusable solutions to the programming problems that we encounter every day.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "`Design patterns are programming language independent strategies, that describe how to solve a problem with greater efficiency. These are like descriptions or roadmap, not a particular implementation. Unlike algorithms, design patterns are a structured collection of objects, associations, and actions to accomplish some goal.`\n",
    "\n",
    "`The main goal is to understand the purpose and usage of each design pattern in order to pick and implement the correct pattern as needed in real-world situations using Python.`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why use design patterns?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Design patterns have predefined set of developments paradigms(i.e rules).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Design patterns speed up the development process.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Design Patterns reduce code complexity and the risk of code breaks\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note :\n",
    "It’s not mandatory to always implement design patterns in projects, but using design patterns, makes code more flexible, readable, and manageable.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Python is an open-source programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Python has libraries that provide support for the list of design patterns, mentioned below.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The syntax of python are easy to understand and similar to English keywords."

    "### Classification of Design patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "`Design patterns are typically split into three categories:`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Creational Design Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "`Creational design patterns deal with the class or object instantiation. Creational Design Patterns are further divided into Class-creational patterns and Object-creational patterns. Class-creation patterns use inheritance effectively in the instantiation process while Object-creation patterns use delegation(i.e object) effectively to get the job done.`\n",

    "### 2. Structural Design Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",

    "Design patterns are based on The SOLID Design Principles.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The SOLID Design Principles\n",
    "\n",
    "`The principle of SOLID coding is an acronym originated by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob), and it stands for five different conventions of coding.`\n",
    "\n",
    "This set of principles is not a specific ordered procedure, rather it is a collection of best practices. Uncle Bob has introduced various Design Principles and among them, the most popular are the five principles acronymic as SOLID Design Principles that are primarily focused on `Object-Oriented` Software Designing.\n",

    "### Single Responsibility Principle(SRP)\n",
    "\n",
    "`“A class should have only one reason to change.“`\n",
    "\n",
    "SRP simply means, a class should have the primary responsibility of the entity and should not take other responsibilities not related to that entity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Single Responsibility Principle asks us not to add additional responsibilities to a class so that we don’t have to modify a class unless there is a change to its primary responsibility.\n",
    "\n",
